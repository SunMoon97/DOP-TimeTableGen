Here are all the constraints based on your requirements for the timetable generation system:

### General Constraints
1. **No Overlapping Sessions**: No two sessions (lectures, tutorials, or labs) for any course can be scheduled in the same time slot.
2. **Avoid 1 PM to 2 PM Slot**: No session (lecture, tutorial, or lab) should be assigned to the 1 PM to 2 PM time slot.
3. **No 8 AM Slot for Lectures and Labs**:
   - Lectures and labs should not be scheduled at 8 AM.
   - Tutorials, however, can be scheduled at 8 AM.

### Lecture Constraints
4. **Lecture Series Separation**:
   - Half of the courses should follow the Mon-Wed-Fri series.
   - The other half should follow the Tue-Thu series.
5. **Consistent Lecture Timing Within Series**: The time slot assigned for a lecture on one day (e.g., Monday) should be the same for the other days in the series (e.g., Wednesday and Friday).
6. **No Consecutive Lecture and Tutorial**: A courseâ€™s tutorial and lecture should not be scheduled back-to-back.

### Tutorial Constraints
7. **Prefer 8 AM Slot for Tutorials**: Tutorials should be scheduled at 8 AM wherever possible. If that slot is unavailable, other slots can be used, but they should not conflict with other sessions for the same course.
8. **First Hour Preference for Tutorials**: Tutorials should be scheduled in the first available hour if possible.

### Lab Constraints
9. **Single Lab per Day**: No more than one lab should be scheduled per day for any course.
10. **Multi-Hour Labs**: Multi-hour labs (e.g., a 2-hour or 3-hour lab) must be scheduled as continuous time blocks. The system should ensure that these blocks are available before assigning the lab.
11. **Avoid 8 AM for Labs**: Labs should not start at 8 AM.
12. **No Lecture and Lab for the Same Course on the Same Day**: A course should not have both a lecture and a lab scheduled on the same day.

### Assignment Constraints
13. **Spread of Courses**: Courses must be spread evenly between the Mon-Wed-Fri and Tue-Thu series.
14. **Random Assignment of Remaining Slots**: If specific timings are not provided for a session, the system should randomly assign it within the constraints mentioned above.
15. **Avoid Randomizing Too Many Courses on the Same Day**: Ensure that courses within the same series (Mon-Wed-Fri or Tue-Thu) do not get clustered excessively on the same day.
16.  divides lectures equally between the Monday (Mon-Wed-Fri) and Tuesday (Tue-Thu) series, while ensuring that the lab for a course is placed on the alternate series.



These constraints are designed to create a balanced and conflict-free timetable. Let me know if there are any other constraints you want to add or if further adjustments are needed!

After generating the timetable for a branch, save the course assignments in an extra sheet, storing the course name, session type (lecture, tutorial, lab), and the assigned day and time.
When generating the timetable for a new branch, check this extra sheet to see if a course has already been assigned. If the course is found, use the same day and time for that course. If not, proceed with the usual logic to assign a time slot and update the extra sheet with the new assignment.
Update the extra sheet with new course assignments after each branch is processed.

or this code the valid slots for lectures for branches starting with A should be (9,10,4,5,2) for both mwf series and tt series 
for branxhes starting with B should be (11,12,3) for both mwf and tt series 

these are only for lectures the rest remiaing lectues ,tuts and labs should follow the same logic as given in surrect code
